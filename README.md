# miscPythonProjects
 Miscellaneous projects that I made as I learned to code with Python
   (each folder is a seperate project)
 
 When I first started programming, it was with Python when I was about 15 years old.  My study started with an online course,
 and kept going with various projects that I decided on and then learned how to do it as I went.
 
 So while some conventions
 are not fully followed, I still posted these here to highlight how I learned to code, and how experienced I am at learning
 new technologies during a project that requires them.
